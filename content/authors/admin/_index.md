I love teaching data science using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical language. 

My R workshops, student's feedback and tutorial slides are available at my website [R4Bee](https://r4b.netlify.app/). I heartily support open-source softwares like R to promote reproducibility and transparency in research and academia.

I care a lot about climate change. My research interests include waste livelihoods & sustainability.

Right now, I'm a full time Assistant Professor at the Department of Travel & Tourism, [Vishwakarma University](https://www.vupune.ac.in/) - Pune, India. I teach research methods (quantitative as well as qualitative) using and Marketing.
